Retail product and category analysis using SQL and Power BI to evaluate pricing, inventory, customer reviews, supplier performance, and return trends for better business decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a large retail product catalog using SQL and Power BI to extract meaningful business insights related to product pricing, stock levels, customer reviews, supplier performance, warehouse trends, and return policies.
